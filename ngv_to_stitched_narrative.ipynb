She's opinionated. She never stops talking. And one day, we'll start an anonymous war, like, about the lamest version of and conspiracy theories about our rank, and it's all going to float. What if we could just show up? And show women peace? Introducing iStop. iStop is the world's first personal silence-filled generator, using advanced directional acoustics, low-dabbing impulses, and a little IP logic. iStop can identify and lower speech patterns in real time, and gently encourage the listener to just stop... And feel calm for a second or less. I like the yellowing, as it soothes. Well, yes. iStop doesn't harm, it doesn't punish. It simply inspires quiet. With iStop, it's discreet, it's elegant, and it just works. We've built it for the classroom, for the office, for Thanksgiving, and yes, even for your Kristen James. Kristen, if you're watching, thank you. This one's for you, and everyone who has a you in their life. Thank you. The iStop will be available in Apple Stores on October 29th for $199.99. Have a wonderful night.</td>\n",
